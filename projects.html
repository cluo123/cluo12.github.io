        Fiber-reinforced composites have been widely used in many industries like aerospace, aeronautical, and automotive engineering due to their high strength to weight ratios. Various design methods have been developed based on topology optimization that capture and fully leverage the promising properties of laminated composites to satisfy stiffness and strength demands relevant to engineering applications. 
<br> <br>We implement a stress-based topology optimization framework for optimizing the fiber orientation of each laminate sheet within a stack (the stacking sequence) and across the structural domain. We consider different failure mechanisms including non-interactive criteria maximum stress and maximum strain, interactive criteria LaRC-2D, and other criteria for predicting delamination initiation.
         The optimization problem is formulated as minimizing the maximum failure index of tow-steered composite laminates subjected to manufacturing constraints related to fiber orientations.

        Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) has proven to be an effective framework for optimizing the material orientations of large-scale orthotropic laminate composite panels across a structural design domain. The typical design problem is one of maximizing stiffness by assigning a material orientation to each predefined subdomain, where the orientation must be selected from a set of discrete magnitudes (e.g., 0°, ±45°, 90°). The subdomain over which orientation is constant is most simply defined as a finite element, ultimately leading to complex orientation layouts that may be difficult to manufacture.
<br> <br>This work utilizes the Heaviside Projection Method within DMO to provide formal control over the minimum length scale of structural features, holes, and patches of uniform orientation. The proposed approach is demonstrated on benchmark maximum stiffness and maximum strength design problems, and numerical results are near-discrete with strict length scale control, providing a direct avenue to controlling complexity of orientation layouts.

        Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapid evolving manufacturing technique due to its capability of producing far more complex structural components than traditional manufactured products. 
		The free-form nature of topology optimization, and its ability to achieve increasingly efficient designs make it a natural design tool for additive manufacturing process. 
		However, additive manufactured components often require additional sacrificial material to support its overhang features and to prevent them from collapsing or warping during the layer-by-layer manufacturing process. 
		Such support structures increase total material usage, building time, and time and cost required for post-processing treatment. 
	<br> <br> This project focuses on implementing a novel and efficient overhang constraint in the topology optimization formulation such that the optimized designs can be directly manufactured in AM without use of any sacrificial support structures. 
		The proposed methodology has been demonstrated to standard minimum weight topology optimization problems and the resulting designs are shown to satisfy minimum length scale, overhang angle, and compliance constraints.

        Many engineered materials and systems are composed of distributions or assemblies of discrete objects or items. Inclusion-based materials such as fiber reinforced composites, hollow sphere composites, and pick-and-place 3D printing are but a few examples.  The discrete object projection method can create distinct objects by actively depositing one phase locally (the object) and simultaneously enclosing this object in a second material phase. However, the nonlinear formulation tends to struggle when the length scales of the object and minimum required spacing become dramatically imbalanced, resulting in the appearance of some smeared, or non-distinct objects.  
<br> <br>We explore this phenomenon and propose alternative approaches to prevent the appearance of phase mixing. Crisp topologies are achieved even in extreme cases of object spacing. The proposed methodology is demonstrated in the context of multiple topology optimization problems, including minimum compliance problems and the design of periodic materials with optimized elastic properties.
